# Workspaces

## Overview

Workspaces represent a consortium of users, computations, and resources that provides a centralized way to manage access control and resources within the Prism system. Each workspace acts as an isolated environment where users can collaborate while maintaining security boundaries.

### Key Features

- **Access Control**: Only users who are members of a workspace can access its assigned resources
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Different users have different roles within a workspace, controlling what operations they can perform (user creation, admin tasks, etc.)
- **Multi-Workspace Support**: A single user can belong to multiple workspaces with different roles in each
- **Required for Access**: All users must be part of at least one workspace and be signed in to access the CoCoS system

## Prerequisites

- Users must have a valid Prism platform account

## Best Practices

- **Role Assignment**: Assign appropriate roles to users based on their responsibilities
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review workspace membership and permissions
- **Naming Convention**: Use clear, descriptive names for workspaces to avoid confusion
- **Access Monitoring**: Monitor workspace access and activity for security purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Access Denied**: Ensure you're signed into the correct workspace and have appropriate permissions
- **Missing Workspaces**: Check that you've been added to the workspace by an administrator
- **Update Failures**: Verify you have sufficient permissions to modify workspace settings
