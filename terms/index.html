                  usage limits, and pricing as described on our website.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Fees are non-refundable except as required by applicable

                <p>
                  If payment fails, we may suspend your access to paid features
                  until payment is resolved. Continued payment failure may
                  result in account termination. If your account is more than 10
                  days past due, access may be suspended until all past-due
                  amounts are paid.

                <h5 class="mt-4">5.5 Cancellation and Refunds</h5>

                  You may cancel your subscription at any time through your
                  account settings or by contacting support. Cancellation takes
                  effect at the end of your current billing period, and you will
                  retain access to paid features until then. Refunds are
                  generally not provided except as required by law or in cases
                  determined by us involving fraud, errors, or violations of our
                  Terms of Service.
